# Progress notes

One `## T-Mx-NN` section per finished task: what shipped, commands/env vars, migrations, open items.

## T-M1-01 — Diagnose premature logout
- Shipped `docs/investigations/session-logout.md` (H1–H7 with evidence). Server-side lifetime ruled out (DB `expires_at` and JWT `exp` = 365 d; keys stable since 2026-08-16; no stray revokes).
- Root causes: (1) `ritme_auth` flag cookie written via `document.cookie` → WebKit 7-day cap, and SessionGuard keeps a user with a valid localStorage token on `/signup`; (2) iOS storage partitioning (Safari tab vs Home Screen app vs in-app browser) — confirmed in prod logs; (3) prod bundle v1.0.2 still clears the token on any 401 (latent).
- Scope edits: T-M1-02 → hardening (401 `error_code`, stop shipping laptop Passport keys via rsync/`COPY`, fix entrypoint creating a 2nd personal client; do NOT rotate keys); T-M1-03 → main fix; T-M1-04 → optional flush + manual tests.
- Open: proxy logs only since 2026-09-07; nginx `log_format` lacks `$host`; real-iPhone check of the 7-day cap pending (T-M1-03).

## T-M1-06 — PWA audit
- Shipped `docs/investigations/pwa-audit.md` (~50 rules, severity + evidence + fix task). Lighthouse 12.8.2 mobile `/fa/signup`: prod Perf 90 / A11y 88 / BP 100 / SEO 100, LCP 3.6s; installability errors `[]`.
- High (T-M1-08): SW `clients.claim()` + `useAppUpdate` reload on any `controllerchange` → every first visit reloads ~2s in; `sw.js` stamped only from package.json version → deploys without a bump never update the SW.
- Med: unbounded runtime cache, no ChunkLoadError recovery, HTML `s-maxage=31536000` behind ArvanCloud (relies on a panel rule), no CSP/HSTS/nosniff (T-M1-08); iOS safe-area on tabbar/toasts, dark status bar, missing `apple-mobile-web-app-capable` (T-M1-09); manifest gaps, `/favicon.ico` 404, upscaled 512 icons (T-M1-07).
- Scope/touches of T-M1-07/08/09 updated. Open: logged-in pages not audited; need ≥1024px logo source; `web.ritme.app` now fronted by ArvanCloud.

## T-M1-04 — Android shell session persistence
- `android-shell/.../MainActivity.kt`: `onStop()` now also flushes cookies. **`android-shell/` is gitignored**, so this lives only in the working tree and ships with the next `build.sh`.
- Verified: no backup/extraction rules restore a stale token, the WebView data dir is stable, and the same release signing key is used across 1.1.0 and 1.1.1 (in-place updates).
- Manual test for a human: install `ritme-1.1.1` → sign in → `am force-stop` → reopen (signed in) → `adb install -r` new release APK → reopen (signed in).

## T-M1-02 — Backend session hardening
- Token lifetime is a fixed `P365D` interval (`config/passport.php`: `token_lifetime_days`=365, `refresh_window_days`=30, env-overridable).
- JSON 401s carry `error_code` ∈ `token_revoked` / `token_expired` / `unauthenticated` (`bootstrap/app.php` report+render callbacks). The admin web redirect is unchanged.
- New `POST /api/v1/auth/refresh-session` (auth:api, throttle 10/min): issues a fresh year and revokes the old token only within 30 days of expiry, otherwise a no-op.
- `entrypoint.sh`: never regenerates existing keys, exits if only one key file is present, warns if keys are missing while tokens exist, and creates the personal client only on a real `count=0`.
- Keys no longer ship: `backend/.dockerignore` `storage/*.key`; `deploy.sh` and `deploy-stage.sh` exclude `backend/storage/*.key` (never add `--delete-excluded`). Prod reads its keys from the `ritme_backend-storage` volume (verified read-only).
- Tests: `tests/Feature/Auth/SessionTokenTest.php` (12). Suite 345 passed; pint green on changed files (14 pre-existing failures elsewhere).
- Follow-ups: rotate the laptop key pair (fingerprint `b501f48dc5d43bdc`), either a forced re-sign-in after T-M1-03 ships and SMS works, or a dual-key validator; delete the stray `/opt/ritme/backend/storage/oauth-*.key`; admin `UserController::destroy` doesn't revoke tokens; consider `dontReport(OAuthServerException)` before 2027-08.

## T-M1-03 — Frontend durable session
- **Main logout fix.** A token in `localStorage` is never dropped because the flag cookie is missing. SessionGuard (`shared/session/reconcile.ts`, pure and tested) re-asserts the flag on every start, route change and resume, and moves signed-in users off `/splash`, `/welcome`, `/signup` and `/otp`. `/signup` and `/otp` stay reachable while onboarding is pending.
- The flag cookie `ritme_auth=1` is now server-set via `POST /api/session/flag` (Next route handler, 1 year, SameSite=Lax, 403 for cross-site requests), which escapes WebKit's 7-day cap on script-set cookies. The JS write remains as a fallback.
- 401 handling (`shared/session/unauthorized.ts`): the session ends only on a JSON 401 for a request that carried the current token, with `error_code` ∈ token_expired/token_revoked/unauthenticated, or the legacy Laravel body. Non-JSON (proxy/Basic-auth) 401s, 5xx and network errors never clear the token. The orchestrator widened this to `unauthenticated` so rotated or deleted tokens don't leave the app stuck.
- Sliding refresh `features/auth` `SessionRefresher` → `POST /auth/refresh-session` when `exp` is less than 30 days away (single-flight, 10-minute backoff, stops on 404/405). `navigator.storage.persist()` runs after sign-in.
- iOS install guide notes the Home Screen app asks for one sign-in; an "open in browser" hint shows in in-app browsers (new `pwa.*` keys; run `php artisan translations:import` on deploy). The dead `ritme_onboarded` branch was removed.
- Verify: typecheck ✔, lint 0 errors (4 pre-existing warnings), steiger ✔, vitest 27 files / 216 tests ✔. Headless CDP manual checks pass (cookie deleted → still signed in; API offline → still signed in).
- Open: needs the stage vhost route for `/api/session/flag` (added in T-M1-08). Human iPhone test pending (Home Screen sign-in once, stays signed in for more than 8 days). The `ritme_onboarding` cookie is still JS-set. Ships to prod only via T-M1-14.

## T-M1-08 — SW lifecycle, caching and headers
- Fixed the double reload on first visit: `useAppUpdate` reloads on `controllerchange` only if the page was already controlled or the user tapped update. A fresh profile now has exactly 1 document load (CDP).
- Every build gets a unique `buildId` (`generate-version.mjs`; `RITME_BUILD_ID` prefix optional). It is stamped into `sw.js`, `version.json` and Next's `generateBuildId` / `NEXT_PUBLIC_BUILD_ID`, so two builds of 1.0.2 produce different `sw.js` and the same version with a new build shows the soft toast. **`public/sw.js` and `public/version.json` are now gitignored** (generated at prebuild, including in Docker).
- SW: per-build precache; one shared runtime cache capped at 150 entries; cache-first for `/_next/static`; navigation preload; 10-second navigation timeout → `offline.html`. `/api`, HTML, `sw.js` and `version.json` are never cached.
- `shared/pwa/chunkReload.ts`: one guarded reload on ChunkLoadError, installed from UpdateGate.
- Headers (`next.config.ts`): documents get `private, no-cache`; all paths get nosniff, Referrer-Policy and **CSP Report-Only** (no report-uri yet).
- nginx: HSTS (1 year, no preload or includeSubDomains) in `proxy-ssl.conf` and the stage vhost; duplicate Cache-Control removed on stage; `location = /api/session/flag` → Next on stage.
- Verify: typecheck/lint (0 errors)/steiger/vitest 216 ✔, `npm run build` ✔, `nginx -t` ✔.
- Deploy notes: `deploy/*` changes reach the shared proxy only via `NO_BUILD=1 ./deploy.sh` (`deploy-stage.sh` doesn't reload nginx). The first deploy shows every user the soft toast once. Check HSTS through ArvanCloud with `curl -I`. Enforce CSP only after checking logged-in pages on staging.
